Who are you, What is your Profession, What kinds of skills do you have related to Cap/Res Sensing
- male 38 yr
- freelance software developer (Linux software for servers, desktops and multimedia but no embedded software)
- no skills related to c/r sensing

What kinds of experince do you have with capacitive and resistive sensing for tangible interactions?
- none whatsoever

What projects did you use TouchLib for?
- none whatsoever; this workshop was the first interaction with touchlib

Describe how you develop project like this one you used TouchLib for, do you use a method?
- command line (not used to Arduino IDE)
- agile (scrum) and iterative development cycle

Describe how you used TouchLib?
- workshop setting

What did TouchLib enable
- more insight into capacitive sensing

How was the project with touchLib different from past expericnes?
- not relevant

Why would you use TouchLib again?


What do you wish TouchLib did differently?
- better separation of generated calibration code from standard arduino sketch code
- code generator is called 'example' but should actually be named 'example generator'
- code generator should not generate code for resistve + capacitive sensing if only capacitive sensing is used
- better API documentation
